# Hi, my love

You have never criticise the moon for not shining the same each night .  You have never looked up at it and say, you're not trying hard enough ,  because the moon doesn't have to be full and bright every night to be loved , and neither do you . 
So I hope that the next person who calls you "beautiful" does so in a way that encompasses all of you .   I hope when they call you beautiful they mean your voice in the morning and those light brown eyes , oh boy!! How they light up when you when we are deep in a conversation .   I hope when they call you beautiful they mean the way you go through tough battles silently and still show up for everyone with a smile.  I hope they mean the way you sleep and the way you cry , the way you love physical touch! but still dread it some night's , and the way you take your tea , the way you love holing someone hands while walking on the road sides, the way summer shorts look cute on you ,  because next time someone calls you beautiful. Nothing about the way you exist should be disregarded .
You are not beautiful in the way a single rose petal is. You are beautiful in the way a garden is .

Yours truly, Dave
